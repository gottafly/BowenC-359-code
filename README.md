This code is anything wretten in c++ or any other language that is not done in labview. 

Gyro sensor-In this file is my code wretten for a adafruit bno005 with a seeeduino XIAO for size and power
This code takes the the x oreatation from 0-360 and puts out a input every 1000 milliseconds or if the value updates and displays the value over sereal 
The use of this project was to replace a navX that was on our robot but had drift and was not very accuarate

Rotory Encoder knob-This is wretten for a rotory encoder(doent remember what one) and a arduino leanardo for no patriculer reason
This code reads value of encoder and displays them over sereal updating every 100 milliseconds
The use of this project was to make a turnable knob that conected to driver satation making it easy to chsose robot oreatation with swerve drive
